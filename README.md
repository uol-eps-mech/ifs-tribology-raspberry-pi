# IFS Tribology Lab Raspberry Pi Data Logger

Information about setting up and using Raspberry Pis in the Tribology lab.

Raspberry Pi 4Bs are used for most of the machines in the Tribology lab and most are setup the same way.

Type A and Type B variants have

* 2 x BNC connectors for +/-10V voltage inputs.
* 2 x K type thermocouple inputs.

In addition, the type A has a 9 way D-Sub for monitoring the rotational speed reported by the pendulum tribometer.

## Setup and testing

To setup the RPi software, see [this document](setup_rpi.md).

There are some notes on testing the final boxes [here](testing.md).

There are some notes and photos on how they are put together [here](construction/construction.md).

I also wrote some [design notes](design.md).
